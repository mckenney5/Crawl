#This is a simple script to compile Crawl on GNU/Linux
#You need the compiler 'vbnc2' to create the program
#For debian, type 'sudo apt-get install vbnc2' and you
#should get the compiler and maybe mono run-time
echo Compiling...
vbnc2 -t:exe -nologo -warnaserror -out:Crawl Crawl.vb
#-t:exe		is for a console program
#-nologo	is for a faster and nicer experience
#-warnaserror	is for making warnings treated like errors (I dont 'do' warnings)
#-out:Crawl	is for naming the program Crawl (no .exe for GNU/Linux)
#Crawl.vb	is the Visual Basic source file
echo Done!
